				Having obtained a diploma in{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>
					building and construction management
				</span>
				, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in several
				coding courses and delved into{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>full-stack web development</span>.{' '}
				<span className='italic'>My favorite part of programming</span> is the
				problem-solving aspect, specifically the structured approach to
				addressing challenges. I <span className='underline'>love</span> the
				feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My primary
				stack includes{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>
					React, Next.js and Headless WordPress
				</span>
				. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I always strive to
				learn new technologies. Currently, I am seeking{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>a permanent position</span> as a software
				developer.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span className='italic'>When I'm not coding</span>, I contemplate the
				meaning of life and enjoy gazing out the window.{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>I also love acquiring new knowledge</span>
				. At the moment, I am studying{' '}
				<span className='font-medium'>
					how to implement beneficial habits and the Kanban system
				</span>
				. Additionally, I have a strong inclination toward standardization to
				maximize productivity in all aspects.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is an understanding that it is impossible to learn and remember
				everything. The idea is to gain some awareness of how to use this or
				that tool, understand the development architecture, and gain a special
				skill to quickly solve problems in a standardized way. The point is to
				standardize and improve the efficiency of all processes.
